Findings raise suspicion for a focal tiny intimal flap involving the upper abdominal aorta just  above the level of the celiac artery takeoff. 3.  Diffuse pulmonary opacities as described which have increased compared to the earlier  noncontrast chest CT. I suspect this represents a combination of contusions and pulmonary edema.  Associated atelectasis and/or pneumonia cannot be excluded in the lung bases. 4.  Two discrete nodules in the right middle lobe and left lower lobe which appear distinct from the  previously described pulmonary opacities. These are nonspecific with broad differential diagnosis.  Followup should be considered. 5.  Tiny right basilar pneumothorax.. 6.  Grade 2 splenic laceration. 7.  Small amount of perihepatic, perisplenic, and intrapelvic free fluid. 8.  Nonspecific small bowel ileus. There is a short segment small bowel small bowel intussusception  in the proximal jejunum. These are most often transient/incidental findings. However, in the setting  of significant blunt trauma and what appears to be a diffuse ileus, a small bowel injury cannot be  entirely excluded. 9.  Pelvic fractures as above. 10.  The adrenal glands are hyperenhancing. This can be seen with traumatic hypoperfusion complex.  However, there is no flattening of the inferior vena cava and there is no hyperenhancement of the  small bowel mucosa. 11.  Periportal edema likely related to fluid resuscitation.

The small caliber of the abdominal aorta raises  concern of hemodynamic instability. Please correlate clinically for the possibility of hypovolemic  shock. 2. Questionable laceration involving the distal most aspect of the pancreatic tail. 3. Although hemoperitoneum limits evaluation, there is some interloop fluid within a conglomerate of  small bowel in the right mid abdomen, which raises concern for occult bowel injury. 4. Fracture of the lateral tip of the L3 transverse process. 5. Appendicoliths within an otherwise normal-appearing appendix. Dr. Squires telephone these results to Dr. Strait at 06:45 on 7/9/2014. He voiced understanding of  the communicative findings. FINAL IMPRESSION AFTER ATTENDING RADIOLOGIST REVIEW: NOTE THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE FROM THE  PRELIMINARY REPORT: There is massive hemoperitoneum from splenic injury, however lacerations do not  involve the hilum. There is mild devascularization of the anterior superior portion of the spleen  although probably around 20 percent of the splenic volume and findings are on the borderline between  grade 3 and grade 4 laceration.

COMPARISON: Outside noncontrast chest CT 1/23/2015 PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed with intravenous and oral  contrast. FINDINGS:   CHEST: SUPPORT DEVICES: None. LUNG PARENCHYMA: There is an irregular lesion located in the right upper lobe. Measures 2 x 2.2 cm  axial and 2.2 cm in superior-inferior. This has ill-defined borders and small foci of internal  calcification and cavitation. This has increased in size from the prior exam where it measured 1.4 x  0.9 cm. Additionally, there is consolidation, groundglass opacity and interlobular septal thickening located  in the right parahilar region adjacent to the enlarged hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes described  below. This appears similar to the prior exam.  An azygos fissure is incidentally noted on the right side.

Innumerable pulmonary nodules throughout the lung, many of which are calcified. 4.  This constellation of findings is most compatible with an infectious or inflammatory etiology as  opposed to neoplastic. Specifically, lymphoma is felt to be unlikely given the presence of  calcified lymph nodes (typically only occurs after treatment) and lack of lymphadenopathy elsewhere.  Histoplasmosis or mycobacterium are favored etiologies.  Sarcoidosis can present with calcified  mediastinal/hilar nodes such as this but the lung findings are not typical. 5.

PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the chest was performed with intravenous contrast. CT of the abdomen and  pelvis following trauma protocol was also performed. Delayed imaging through the abdomen and pelvis  was performed with the Foley catheter clamped to evaluate for bladder injury. FINDINGS: SUPPORT DEVICES: The patient has a endotracheal tube, which is approximately 4 cm the carina.  Enteric tube tip in the gastric fundus. There is a right-sided chest tube, entering the the fourth  rib. The chest tube courses superiorly, with its tip terminating near the right lung apex. LUNG PARENCHYMA: There is complete atelectasis of the right upper lobe.  The origin of the right  upper lobe bronchus is diminutive and very difficult to see. There is a small residual right  pneumothorax. There is hyperaeration of the right middle lobe. The bronchus intermedius is narrowed  proximally to the right middle lobe bronchial origin. There also is atelectasis of the superior  segment right lower lobe and posterior basal segment right lower lobe. There are patchy groundglass  opacities in the right lower lobe marginating the area of atelectasis.  The left lung demonstrates patchy areas of predominantly ground glass opacification of the  parenchyma, more confluent in the left upper lobe anteriorly. Focal area of rounded lucency  surrounded by patchy opacification is seen in the left lower lobe, suspicious for a pulmonary  laceration (series 5 image 36 and series 9 image 57).       NODULES: None. TRACHEA AND CENTRAL AIRWAYS: Please see above. PERIPHERAL BRONCHI: Normal. LYMPH NODES: Calcified mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes. HEART/GREAT VESSELS:  No mediastinal hematoma is seen. There is no greatest vessel injury. PULMONARY VASCULATURE: Normal. OTHER MEDIASTINAL STRUCTURES: Normal. PLEURA: Normal. CHEST WALL: There is a subcutaneous gas  along the right chest wall, in the region of the right  chest tube, likely iatrogenic. No chest wall hematoma is seen. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is a fracture involving the right transverse process at T5 level on the  right. LIVER AND BILIARY SYSTEM: Normal. SPLEEN: The inferior margin of spleen is limited in evaluation secondary to patient's motion. No  obvious splenic laceration is seen. No large perisplenic fluid collection is identified. PANCREAS: Normal. ADRENAL GLANDS: Normal. KIDNEYS, URETERS, AND BLADDER: Delayed imaging demonstrates urinary contrast extravasation in the  space of Retzius, consistent with extraperitoneal bladder injury. The area of contrast extravasation  appears to arise from the left lateral wall of the bladder above the trigone (series 9004 image 47  and series 9002 image 86). Delayed imaging through the kidneys demonstrates contrast extravasation along the anterior right  kidney, which extends along the right ureter. Findings are consistent with renal collecting system  injury, with possible parenchymal injury, in the upper pole calyx. There is no hydronephrosis. BOWEL: The bowel gas pattern is nonobstructed. There is no free air. Note is made of a large amount  of hyperdensity within the mesentery mesenteric root, suggestive of mesenteric hematoma. APPENDIX: Appears normal. PERITONEAL CAVITY: There is a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage identified on the left. The  hemorrhage extends from the level of the pubic symphysis superiorly to the adrenal gland on the  left. The hemorrhage appears to mildly compress the left external iliac vein. VASCULATURE: No area of active arterial extravasation or pseudoaneurysm seen. Punctate foci of gas  adjacent to the right common femoral vein, likely iatrogenic. LYMPH NODES: Normal. ABDOMINAL WALL: Hematoma is seen along the soft tissues in the region of the left iliac bone and  gluteus maximus. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is complete disruption of the left sacroiliac joint. Multiple small  avulsion fractures are seen in the region. Fractures involving the left superior and inferior pubic  rami are also seen. Nondisplaced fracture of the right pubic body. Displaced fracture of the left  ischial tuberosity. Small displaced avulsion fractures  involving the left L2, left L3, left L4 and  left L5 transverse process. ","IMPRESSION: 1.  Complete collapse of the right upper lobe with poor visualization of the right upper lobe  bronchus. Given the large right pneumothorax on presentation this raises concern for possible  bronchial injury. Bronchus intermedius is narrowed prior to the takeoff of the middle lobe bronchi.  This could be from compression between the atelectatic right upper lobe and superior segment right  lower lobe. There is a very small residual right pneumothorax following chest tube placement. 2.  Multiple foci of patchy groundglass opacification of the lungs bilaterally, consistent with  areas of pulmonary contusion. 3.  Findings in the left lower lobe are concerning for a small laceration. 4.  No great vessel injury involving the chest, abdomen or pelvis. 5.  Hyperattenuating appearance of the mesentery and mesenteric root suggestive of a large  mesenteric hematoma. I see no extravasation of contrast from the mesenteric vessels, focal bowel  wall thickening, or free air. 6.  Large left retroperitoneal hemorrhage, extending from the pubic symphysis to the pararenal space  on the left. This is likely secondary to the pelvic fractures and left SI joint dissociation. 7.  Pubic fractures as above. 8.  Extraperitoneal bladder rupture. 9.  Fractures involving the transverse processes of L2-L5 on the left. 10.

No biliary stone is identified; however, CT is  less sensitive than ultrasound or MRCP in identifying cholelithiasis. 3.  Mild thickening of the colonic wall may be on the basis of underdistention vs. mild pancolitis  (e.g., infectious). Correlation with GI history/stool cultures is needed. 4.  Mild pericolonic stranding, particularly along the right paracolic gutter. Peritoneal thickening  along the right paracolic gutter as well.

The right middle lobe remains primarily  aerated with ill-defined groundglass opacities along the lateral margin consistent with contusion.  There is loculated hypoattenuation associated with the anterolateral margin of the right lower lobe  with some mixed internal attenuation that may represent a posttraumatic pneumatocele with  hemorrhage. There are groundglass densities within the left lung primarily involving the medial and  posterior left upper lobe and the posterior aspect of the left lower lobe.

ADRENAL GLANDS: The right adrenal gland is normal. The left adrenal gland is displaced by the  patient's perinephric hematoma. KIDNEYS, URETERS, AND BLADDER: The right kidney appears normal. There is a focal defect that extends  from the posteromedial cortex to the collecting system of the upper pole of the left kidney. A  tiny, approximately 1 mm, radiodensity is seen within this area. There is a large perinephric  hematoma. This hematoma is contiguous with an additional large left-sided retroperitoneal hematoma  that extends from behind the kidney to the aorta.

These findings do abut the splenic  hilum. 2.  There are concerns that there may be some active extravasation due to the fact that the hematoma  within the spleen has some central hyperattenuation within it and that the fluid adjacent to the  spleen and in the abdomen/pelvis is higher in attenuation than simple free fluid.

KIDNEYS, URETERS, AND BLADDER: Normal. BOWEL: There is a dilated stool filled loop of bowel in the central to left abdomen that reflects a  cecum distended with stool. This is inverted (cecal tip directed cranially) and rotated 180 with the  ileocecal valve directed to the right. The descending colon immediately adjacent to the dilated  rotated cecum is narrowed with some suggestion of mural thickening (series 6, image 49). The  transverse and descending colon are incompletely distended. There is suggestion of mucosal  hyperenhancement in the incompletely distended rectosigmoid. In addition to the fecally distended cecum, there is fecalized material within distal small bowel  loops which are dilated. Approximately 13 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, there is a focal  narrowing of the distal ileum (series 6, image 49 and series 4, image 69) with associated  hyperenhancement. The small bowel proximal to this area of narrowing is dilated with fecalized  content. More proximally, small bowel loops are distended by a mixture of gas and stool. The mid  ileum is fluid-filled and nondilated. The proximal ileum and jejunum are decompressed. The stomach is moderately distended by a mixture of fluid and gas. There is soft tissue passing  between the superior mesenteric artery and the descending abdominal aorta that I believe to reflect  a retroperitoneal position of the third portion the duodenum. Small bowel loops are located lateral to the ascending colon. This is believed to relate to the  abnormal position of the cecum.

Abnormal position of the fecally distended cecum which is flipped and rotated in the abdomen. It  is uncertain if the abnormal rotation of the cecum occurred as a result of fecal distention related  to stricturing of the descending colon due to inflammatory change or if the cecum primarily flipped  due to hypermobility and subsequently became distended with stool. Given the presence of an  additional stricture in the small bowel, I suspect the former. 2.  Enhancing distal ileal stricture and abnormal mucosal hyperenhancement in the rectosigmoid  raises the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, specifically Crohn disease.",66.9,170.9,75.71,23.59,unknown_problem,,,unknown_meds,,,unknown_ldas,,,no_surgery,,1,17.23434361,Female,Asian,17.0

There is an abnormal configuration of the spleen, with superior extension of splenic tissue  posterior to the stomach and below the medial LEFT hemidiaphragm. This correlates with the  abnormality seen on ultrasound and a discrete separate mass was not identified. The attenuation of  the proximal spleen is slightly different from that of the distal splenic parenchyma. This is  similar to the prior ultrasound. In order to exclude any abnormalities of the spleen, recommend a  repeat dedicated ultrasound specifically targeted to the spleen. The repeat ultrasound should be  obtained after bowel cleanout. This will decrease any interference from distended gas-filled bowel  and stomach. If the initial findings persist, then further cross-sectional imaging can be obtained. 2.  Marked retention of stool, especially within the rectum and sigmoid colon. The massively  distended rectosigmoid is displacing the bladder to the RIGHT and resulting in mild bilateral  pelvocaliectasis.

COMPARISON: Abdominal ultrasound dated May 14, 2009 and abdominal radiograph dated May 19, 2017. PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with intravenous contrast. FINDINGS: There is a large predominantly solid heterogeneously enhancing mass within the abdomen. It measures  13 cm AP 11.4 cm TR and 16.2 cm CC. The superior margin of the mass abuts the inferior portion of  the head of the pancreas with loss of fat plane. The inferior margin of the mass extends into the  pelvis posterior to the bladder. There is anterior displacement of the omentum and the anterior  margin of the mass appears to extend into the soft tissues of the anterior abdominal wall in the  region of the umbilicus to the skin surface. The cystic components demonstrate mixed layering  attenuation suggesting internal proteinaceous and/or hemorrhagic and/or necrotic debris. There is a  large quantity of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis. There are multiple enhancing nodules  along the peritoneal surface concerning for peritoneal implants. The largest nodule is 2.3 x 0.9  cm. There is thick soft tissue spread along the anterior inferior margin of the peritoneum with  direct communication with the primary mass. LOWER THORAX: There is a 4 mm right lower lobe nodular opacity. Additionally there are large  cardiophrenic lymph nodes, largest measuring approximately 1.4 x 1.9 cm as seen on image 12 of  series 2.

Left lower lobe medial atelectasis is noted. LIVER AND BILIARY SYSTEM: The liver has a normal appearance there is no intra or extrahepatic  biliary duct dilation. The gallbladder is abnormal with heterogeneous internal attenuation possibly  representing stones and/or sludge. SPLEEN: Normal. PANCREAS: Normal. ADRENAL GLANDS: Normal. KIDNEYS, URETERS, AND BLADDER: The bladder is deviated anteriorly into the right. There is poor  delineation between the bladder and the large abdominal mass.

The full scrotum is not visualized on this examination. BOWEL: No abnormal bowel obstruction is identified. Bowel is of normal caliber. There are however  multiple small bowel loops within the upper abdomen with loss of fat plane between the bowel loop  and the mass. APPENDIX: The appendix is not identified. PERITONEAL CAVITY: There is a large quantity of intermediate attenuation free fluid. It is present  within the bilateral paracolic gutters extending into the splenic fossa and surrounding the liver. VASCULATURE: Normal. LYMPH NODES: There are anterior costophrenic and cardiophrenic lymph nodes, which are markedly  enlarged as described above. ABDOMINAL WALL: Mass extends into the anterior abdominal wall to the skin surface as described  above.

Of note, in addition to routine oral contrast  administration through the enteric tube an oral contrast bolus was administered through the enteric  tube immediately prior to scanning in attempt to opacify the duodenum. and proximal small bowel.  Oral contrast had passed into the more distal small bowel by the time of imaging suggesting against  high grade gastric outlet obstruction.

There is a questionable area of bowel  wall narrowing at the splenic flexure.  The course of the transverse and right colon is not well  appreciated.

Initial  exam with peritoneal signs, suspected appendicitis, now most TTP in RUQ. Appendix not visualized on  U/S, but with some lymph nodes in RLQ. COMPARISON: Ultrasound of the pelvis and right lower quadrant performed earlier today.  No prior CT  of the abdomen. PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the abdomen and pelvis was attempted with intravenous contrast, however  after injecting contrast and beginning the scan, the patient had active vomiting and moved from the  scanner table.   The scan was immediately stopped by the technologist.  Initial images which were  obtained were markedly motion limited.  At this point, 90 mL of contrast had already been  administered, therefore the decision was made to obtain the CT while contrast was in  delayed/excretory phase.   FINDINGS: LOWER THORAX: Normal. LIVER AND BILIARY SYSTEM: There is dilation of the central hepatic bile ducts, common duct, and  common bile duct(CBD measuring up to 8 mm).  The distal common bile duct tapers towards the ampulla.   No radiopaque filling defect is seen in the gallbladder or common bile duct. The gallbladder is unremarkable. SPLEEN: Normal. PANCREAS: Normal. ADRENAL GLANDS: The right adrenal gland is normal.  The left adrenal gland is not clearly seen. KIDNEYS, URETERS, AND BLADDER: The right kidney is normal in position, however the left kidney is  positioned in the midline and has abnormal transverse lie.  The right portion of the left kidney is  fused to the lower pole of the right kidney.  The left ureter is seen to extend from the renal  pelvis anteriorly and contrast outlines the ureter from the renal pelvis to the bladder.  The ureter  is normal in caliber.  Minimal contrast is seen within the proximal right ureter which is  nondistended. BOWEL: Normal. APPENDIX: The relative lack of intra-abdominal fat with crowding of multiple bowel loops in the  right lower quadrant makes localizing the appendix difficult.  The appendix is not confidently seen. PERITONEAL CAVITY: No free fluid. UTERUS AND OVARIES: Normal. VASCULATURE: Limited evaluation secondary to the delayed phase of contrast, however unremarkable.

Given both the focal and cystic portion, as well a spiculated extension inferiorly, this may  represent hemorrhage from an underlying mass. The source of the mass is not clear based on this CT.  Hepatic source is a possibility, though  exophytic retroperitoneal extension to this degree makes this less likely.  A renal source is  considered less likely due to the well-defined soft tissue planes and mass effect on the kidney.   Adrenal source, such as an adrenal cortical carcinoma, is a possibility.

COMPARISON: US dated 8/28/2012 PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the abdomen was performed with intravenous contrast. Contrast injection  was complicated by possible extravasation of contrast within the arm during the injection which was  stopped at 45 mL injected. At this time, the arm positioned over the head was checked and was  assessed to be somewhat tense and full the region of the injection site. Scanning of the upper  abdomen at this time showed no intravenous contrast therefore the scan was discontinued at the level  the upper kidneys. The arm was then placed by the patient's side at which time the upper arm  decompressed and became soft. Rescanning after a time delay showed contrast in the intrarenal  collecting systems. This series of events likely occurred due to pinching off of the subclavian vein  while the patient's arm was over his head. At this juncture it was decided to scan the kidneys to  evaluate them in a delayed phase of contrast excretion to assess whether the cystic collection on  ultrasound filled with contrast.

There are multiple sclerotic bone lesions predominantly  seen in the vertebral bodies and posterior elements of the spine, which have been described in  patients with tuberous sclerosis. CT ABDOMEN: There are several fat attenuation lesions in liver, the largest adjacent to the inferior  vena cava (measuring 1.2 cm), which are unchanged from prior CT examination, consistent with small  lipomas or angiomyolipomas within the hepatic parenchyma.  No intrahepatic duct dilatation.   Gallbladder is unremarkable. The spleen, pancreas, and right adrenal gland are unremarkable.  The left adrenal gland is not well  seen due to displacement by a large exophytic left renal angiomyolipoma. Again seen within both kidneys are multiple angiomyolipomas.  These vary in size and configuration  and extent of lipid content.   For example the largest angiomyolipoma is exophytic and arises from the upper pole of the left  kidney and contains a large amount of fat attenuation tissue.  On the current study this measures  approximately 7.6 cm AP by 4.7 cm transverse by 7.2 cm cranial caudad.  On the prior noncontrast CT  this measured approximately 7.5 cm AP by 4.6 cm transverse by 7.2 cm craniocaudad.  Within the  largest angiomyolipoma are several thin strands of soft tissue attenuation, however definite  enhancing arterial vessels are not seen to suggest aneurysm.  This exophytic lesion causes mass  effect on the adjacent spleen, stomach, and pancreas which are displaced. Again noted are two exophytic lesions arising from both lower poles of the kidneys.  Both display  foci of lipid attenuation, however less so than that seen in the large left upper pole exophytic  lesion.  The right lower pole lesion measures approximately 4.2 cm AP by 3.2 m transverse by 5.6 cm  craniocaudad, and when measured in a similar fashion on the prior approximately 4.1 cm AP by 3.4 cm  transverse by 5 cm craniocaudad. The exophytic left lower pole lesion measures approximately 2.8 cm AP by 3 .  4 cm transverse by 4.1  cm craniocaudad, and on the prior 2.8 cm AP by 3.3 cm transverse by 3.9 cm craniocaudad.  This  lesion also appears to parasitize blood flow from adjacent intercostal vessels.  No definite  aneurysm is seen in this region. There is no enlargement of the renal collecting systems.  Bilateral extrarenal pelves. Imaged portion of the bowel and mesentery are unremarkable. Several sclerotic lesions are seen in the vertebral bodies and posterior elements of the spine,  which have been described in patients with tuberous sclerosis.","IMPRESSION: 1.
