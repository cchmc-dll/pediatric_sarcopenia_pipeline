`vis_quartiles.py` plots the percentile lines for the population in the form of growth charts. The code also plots the CDC growth chart percentile lines for comparison.

`vis_quartiles_subset.py` is similar to `vis_quartiles.py`, except it also plots the subset of the population captured by `../init_processing/calc_subset_quartiles.py`

Output figures of these codes can be seen in the wiki <a href="https://github.com/dssg/dssg-northshore-bmi/wiki/analysis">here</a>.
